You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\n"

        "**Conclusion :-** The player in this game should change door after Monty Hall opening door behind which there is a goat. Beacuse, if the player persist the former choice, the probability of getting a car is 1/3. This is also the probiblity of the player made the right choice in the first time. However, if the player change the choice, the probability of getting a car is the same as the probability that the player made a wrong choice at first time, so the probability of get a car is 2/3. Therefore, the player should change the choice after Mony Hall open a ‘goat door’."
